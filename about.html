            <p style="font-weight: 600">1. How did you become a designer?</p>
            <p>
              Here's a cliche: ever since I was a kid I aspired to make the
              world a better place. That's why I chose to major in industrial
              engineering, so that I can learn the magic of 'Kaizen', or
              optimization methodologies. The years in college taught me to
              think systematically; but I was not the best student because of my
              weakness in math. However, I discovered my true passion and
              strength in human-computer interaction as a track of IE. It feels
              like the destiny calls: I got to combine my interest in design
              with my background in engineering, AND to achieve my ultimate goal
              of making people's lives easier.
            </p>

              After graduation I decided to continue to learn more about HCI. I
              got in the MS-HCI program at Georgia tech, where I leveled up my
              design skills and pushed boundaries in the field of persuasive
              technology through a two-year research project. I almost ended up
              being a user researcher; but I couldn't give up the joy of
              crafting beautiful things. So here I am, a happy product designer
              who sometimes does research a little bit of coding!

              I was born and raised in Beijing, a city that boasts thousands of
              years of history yet is still evolving rapidly. It has taught me
              to always embrace changes and dream big.
