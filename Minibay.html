					Living away from our elderly parents and grandparents, we all
					have these worries for them-
				</p>
				<p class="para1" style="">"Are they eating healthy?"</p>
				<p class="para1" style="">"What do they need?"</p>
				<p class="para1" style="">"What can we do for them?"</p>
				<p class="para1" style="">
					These concerns lead us to think about the general elderly
					population and their special needs when it comes to managing
					their food, a very important factor towards living healthy
					lives.

		<h5>Needs Analysis</h5>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p class="para1" style="">
					Based on our preliminary user study with the team members'
					parents and grandparents, we identified the elders’ special
					needs.
				</p>
				<p class="para1" style="margin-left: 15px">
					1. Due to a loss in memory, they tend to forget the date they
					buy in certain food, and fail to finish eating certain food in
					time;
				</p>
				<p class="para1" style="margin-left: 15px">
					2. They are in great need of a balanced and nutritious diet, but
					lack related knowledge;
				</p>
				<p class="para1" style="margin-left: 15px">
					3. They have to do grocery shopping for themselves in most
					cases, which is physically demanding;
				</p>
				<p class="para1" style="margin-left: 15px">
					4. They have limited ability to take advantage of technology,
					which make it even harder for them to solve the previous three
					problems by themselves;
				</p>
				<p class="para1" style="">
					Meanwhile, their care providers are looking for better ways to
					meet the needs of their elderly family members. Living
					separately from their children, the elderly need the care from
					their children far more than any kind of technology solutions;
					however, children are often hindered by the high communication
					cost to provide effective care. We want to help both sides
					through a new design.

		<h5>Design Process</h5>

		<h7>System Design</h7>

		<div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p class="para1">
					We came up with three important features that our system should
					have in order to meet our target user's needs (on the right).
				</p>
				<p class="para1">
					To monitor inventory, we want to explore the possibility of
					computer vision technology. We will then be able to update the
					realtime inventory status to a database, which can communicate
					with both the elderly and their care providers.
				</p>
				<p class="para1">
					The interface on the elders' side should be easy to use and
					taken their special needs into consideration. Therefore, we want
					to utilize a combination of touch-based dashboard display and a
					smart speaker.
				</p>
				<p class="para1">
					On the care providers' end, a mobile app would be the best
					solution as they can get the information they want on the go,
					especially when they are shopping.
				</p>
				<p class="para1">
					The following storyboard further communicates our idea of the
					scenario:

		<h5>Mobile UI Design</h5>
		<p class="para1" style="">
			Below is a snippet of the Andorid app UI design that I was
			responisble for: the inventory page and the inventory item detail
			page.

				<h7>Requirements</h7>

				<p class="para1" style="">
					The preliminiary user study focusing on speech-based interaction
					indicated that the elders want to use the speech interface to
					ask about the following questions:
				</p>
				<ol style="margin-left: 25px">
					<li>
						How long have this item been in my freezer? Is it still good
						to eat?
					</li>
					<li>Is the temperature of the refrigerator good?</li>
					<li>
						Based on what I have in the fridge, am I eating healthy
						enough? What else should I get to be healthy?
					</li>
					<li>
						Based on what I have in the fridge and the expiration date of
						the items, what recipe should I consider?
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h7 style="margin-left: 20px">Guidelines</h7>

				<ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 10px">
					<li>Use Confirmation Selectively</li>
					<li>
						Avoid dialogs that create too many confirmations, but confirm
						actions of high consequence
					</li>
					<li>Enhance Discovery</li>
					<li>Include “full intent” examples</li>
					<li>Make Sure Users Know They are in the Right Place</li>
					<li>
						Using landmarks tells users that Alexa heard them correctly,
						orients them in the interaction, and helps to instill trust in
						your experience.
					</li>
					<li>Present Information in Consumable Pieces</li>
					<li>Use Re-Prompting to Provide Guidance</li>
				</ul>
