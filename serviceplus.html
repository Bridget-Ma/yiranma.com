								<h5>Defining the Problem</h5>

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-lg-12" id="nav">
										<!--
    <p class="para1" >
  Lack of consistency has always been an outstanding problem for Adobe Creative Cloud apps. It creates an entrance barrier for new users, as well as for expert users to take up new apps. 
</p>
-->

										<!-- <p class="par1" >
“While there are many ways to rate and review restaurants, these are not focused on evaluating individuals servers. “
</p>
<p class="par" >
At first sight, this design prompt elicits a brilliant idea: there is an opportunity for a new system that makes up for a missing part in customer experience and also help individual servers. However, I am more concerned by the subsequent thought, “Is this a real and valid need?”  Although individual servers play an important part in a good dining experience, and current systems do not focus on evaluating individual servers, this does not necessarily mean that diners or servers need or will use a new system. Additionally, this is also a question of whether a new experience will 
<strong style="font-style: italic; vertical-align: top;">really</strong> have a postive impact on both parties.</p>
<p class="par" >
These concerns drove me to dig deeper and find answers to the following questions:
</p> -->
										<p class="par1" >

											What do diners and servers need that is currently missing in the
											diner-server interaction system?
										</p>
										<!-- <p class="par1" >
What will help people in the system to accomplish their goals and, additionally, have a positive impact in their lives?

</p> -->

									</div>

									<p class="par" >
										I started my research by talking to people in different roles in the system:
										diner, server and staff manager.
									</p>
									<div align="middle">
										<img src="images/gde/research1.png" width="90%">
									</div>

									<p class="par" >
										Beside the former highlights excerpted from a number of interviews with those in
										the server-diner system, I found that people do share a common interest-achieve
										better service. For servers, it means more income (tips) and career success. For
										diners, better service means a better dining experience and they also would love
										to help the servers out when they can. For managers, better service means a good
										reputation, happy customers and business success.
									</p>
									<p class="par" >
										However, the story is not always a happy one. All three parties encounter
										different frustrations in their attempts to get/provide better service.
									</p>

									<img src="images/gde/Frustrations.png" width="100%">

									<p class="caption">
										&#8593; Current practices and frustrations on the three roles
									</p>
								</div>




								<p class="par1" >
									So what can design makes a difference in this process?
									What will make a successful and impactful design?
								</p>
								<p class="par" >
									During my interviews, I found it hard to get peoples opinion on something that does
									not yet exist. I tried to get insight into their values and intents by asking the
									following questions.
								</p>
								<p class="par" style="font-weight: 500">
									Questions posed to diners:
								</p>
								<p class="par2" >
									What do you think will make it easier to complain/compliment your server? <br />
									What do you think will make it more likely to give feedback about your server’s
									service?
									<br />
									If there is a way to rate and review your server on a platform you currently use to
									review restaurants, would you use it and why? What If it’s on a separate platform
									and why?
								</p>
								<p class="par" style="font-weight: 500">
									Questions posed to servers:
								</p>
								<p class="par2" >
									What do you think will make it easier to know what customers feel about your
									service?
									<br />
									If there is an effective way for customers to give you feedback on your service, how
									would that help and why?
								</p>
								<p class="par" >
									Excerpted responses from the above questions are shown below.
								</p>

								<div align="middle" style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px">
									<img src="images/gde/research2.png" width="90%">
								</div>


								<p class="par" >
									I arrived at the conclusion that diners are worried about a system that will expose
									themselves while servers are quite open to a system that would connect them better
									to the diners but do not see any big benefit to themselves.
								</p>

								<p class="par" >
									Thus, I believe that a successful system should have the following features:
								</p>

								<p class="par2" >
									Easy and fast for diners to give feedback.</p>
								<p class="par2" >
									Make diners feel safe when giving negative feedback.</p>
								<p class="par2" >
									Clear benefits to the servers: help them make more money and succeed in their
									careers.</p>
								<p class="par2" >
									Clear benefits to the business: help manage staff and monitor reviews.
								</p>

								<p class="par" >
									Having now interviewed a number of people representative of the stakeholders at
									large, and identifying the key features that would be required in a solution
									satisfactory to all parties I began to generate different ideas for possible
									systems.
								</p>

								<h5 id="design">Ideation</h5>

								<p class="par" >
									For the diner’s experience, I narrowed down the possibilities to six major options
									after a brainstorming session, and then compared the pros and cons of each idea.
									Below is the result of the aforementioned session.
								</p>
								<div align="center">
									<img src="images/gde/Ideation.png" width="80%">
								</div>

								<p class="caption">
									&#8593; Brainstorming on the entry-point: diner’s expereince
								</p>

								<p class="par"
									style="font-weight: 200; font-size: 18pt; margin-top: 40px;margin-bottom: 40px">
									Design decisions
								</p>

								<p class="par" >
									Some of these ideas are easy and cheap to deploy, but they have limited impact on
									the status quo.
									However, I decide to design a future-facing experience, which should be flexible
									enough to adapt to many possible scenarios, and be able to generate and process data
									at a high speed. Most importantly, it should be capable of easy acceptance, while
									also able to change how people do things: <strong
										style="font-style: italic; vertical-align: top;">radically</strong> .
								</p>



								<p class="par" >
									Therefore, I decided to proceed based on the Tablet POS idea. This is how I envision
									the system work:
								</p>

								<p class="par2" >
									The tablet will be in a similar size to a check case, and embedded in a check case
									just like an ordinary paper check. The familiarity will make it easier to be
									accepted, and the protection case also creates a safer place to rate and review.
								</p>
								<p class="par2" >
									Diners will rate and review the server before tipping, and get recommendations on
									how much to tip based on their sentiments, motivating them to tip more when they
									have a good experience with the server.
								</p>
								<p class="par2" >
									Although this solution will require some investment on the restaurant’s side, it has
									strong capability to receive and provide rich data (and real money) to benefit the
									other two parties in the system. </p>
								<br />
								<p class="par3" >
									Based on this decision, the design solution for the other two parties also become
									clear. </p>
								</p>
								<p class="par3" ><strong style="font-weight: 600; vertical-align: top;">On the
										wait staff’s side,</strong> they will see their daily performance as well as
									aggregated feedback from diners. Additionally, the system incoporates
									algorithmically discerned insights that help them achieve better performance and
									career success. Their respective record is shared with their current employee, and
									they can also choose to share past success with a potential future employee. </p>
								<p class="par3" >
									<strong style="font-weight: 600; vertical-align: top;"> On the restaurant manager’s
										side</strong>, there will be a dashboard that helps them monitor waiting staff’s
									performance and act upon diner’s feedback.

									System design


								</p>

								<p class="par" >
									The digital check design will be primarily targeting mid- to high-end restaurants,
									where the waiting staff generally care more about their service level and
									self-improvement, and the business owners are more likely to invest in the system to
									achieve better service.

								</p>
								<p class="par" >
									It is equally important to promote better service to a broader range of restaurants
									that might not be able to afford the former solution or do not have a dedicated
									server for each table. Fast food chains are the major target for this alternative
									design. Business owners can choose to display their staff on the restaurant page on
									Google Maps to receive feedback on individual servers.

 	Scope of design

 </p>
 -->


								<p class="par" >
									Because of the limited time frame, I decided to focus on two components of this
									system:</p>
								<p class="par" >
									1. The digital check, which will take form of a tablet embedded in the check
									case.<br />

									2. Waiting staff’s portal, which will be a mobile app known as ServicePlus. An
									mobile app fits well into their work style-they do not have workstations and are
									always on the go.</p>


								<h5 id="design">User Stories</h5>



								<p class="par" >
									One evening, Yiran and her friend just had a nice dinner at their favorite
									restaurant. When getting the check back, their waiter David said:"I will really
									appreaciate if you can give me some feedback on this e-check. Hope you ladies have a
									lovely evening!"
								</p>

								<div class="row" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">
									<div class="col-md-2 ">

									<div class="col-md-7 ">

										<div class="col-md-3 ">
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p class="par3" >
									Yiran took the check and opened it. It was the first time she used this new digital
									check of this restaurant. She was asked what she felt about David's service. </p>
								<p class="par3" >
									"He surely did a good job" Yiran said to herself and tapped on the smiling face. The
									next question poped up-</p>
								<p class="par3" >
									"What he did well? I don't think there is anything wrong with him," she thought,
									"...not timely, I have to say, because we waited a bit long for the spoons." </p>
								<p class="par3" >
									Within a few taps, Yiran has finished giving feedback to David, much shorter than
									she had expected.</p>
								</p>
								<div class="row" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">

									<div class="col-md-1">

								<p class="par3" >
									The digital check gave Yiran a few tipping options. She immedaitely tapped 20%, the
									standard amount she tips when the service is fair. However, she noticed that the
									recommended percentage was 25%, and this was based on her previous rating. </p>
								<p class="par3" >
									This made her think about David again: "It's a nice dinner, and he gave us great
									suggestions...He deserves more than the normal amount."</p>
								<p class="par3" >
									After the short hesitation, she made up her mind and completed the payment smoothly,
									feeling good about herself for helping the waiter out and being generous.</p>

									<div class="col-md-1">

								<p class="par3" >
									After the extra busy evening, David the waiter went back home and finally relaxed
									himself. He thought he could check out the ServicePlus app. "It told me to work on
									making good suggestions to get more good reviews, and I have tried hard on that one.
									Let's see if it worked..."</p>
								<p class="par3" >
									He launched the Dashboard, and was glad to find out from the Insight card that he
									did a really good job-"Hah! I'm the top 5%!" </p>
								<p class="par3" >
									He also found out that although he got better reviews than yesterday, he got fewer
									tips-though still above average.</p>
								<p class="par3" >

								</p>

								<p class="par" >
									Talking to users is one of my favorite part in a design process. To develop a good
									understanding of the entire system, I used every chance to approach and chat with
									the service staff in every restaurant/eatery I went to throughout the week. A
									request from the customer to talk to them about their job is not something they
									would expect. Some appeared nervous as if I was sent by the management on a secret
									investigation. It was a challenge to get the right timing, acquiring enough
									information while not making them uncomfortable as they were busy with their job.
									Thus, I tried to always ask the right questions by iterating on the interview script
									on the go. After each interview, I would retrospect on the conversations, go through
									the notes, identify the most effective questions and improve the way I deliver a
									question based on how well people reacted to it.

								<p class="par" style="font-weight: 500">
									Splitting a bill</p>

								<p class="par" >
									When a big party wants to split bill, there might not be enough tablets for each
									diner. I envision it not be of a big problem in the near future when tablets become
									more affordable. For the time being, the restaurant will have several alternatives:
								</p>
								<p class="par" >

									A. Let diners use the digital check one by one. This ensure that everyone is treated
									the same way, but will be time consuming.

								</p>
								<p class="par" >
									B. Give the digital check to one of the diner in a group, and print paper checks
									with a small feedback form for the others. This ensures every diner gets the check
									quickly, but requires extra processing and is not as effective in collecting
									feedback.</p>

								<p class="par" style="font-weight: 500">
									Paying by cash</p>
								<p class="par" >
									This solution is also built on the assumption that a majority of diners will pay by
									card. If choosing to pay by cash, diners will be less likely to engage with the
									digital check and less likely to follow the recommendation from the system.
									Nevertheless, this solution still makes it easier for these diners to provide
									feedback to the waiting staff.
								</p>
								<br />
								<br />
								<p class="par2" style="margin-left: 18%; font-size: 16pt">
									An alternative solution
								</p>
								<p class="par" >
									For restaurants that could not afford the proposed solution or do not have a
									dedicated server for each table (e.g.fast food chains), promoting good service is
									equally important. For their case, I would like to propose an althernaitve solution.
									Restaurant owners can put their personnel info up on the restaurant page on Google
									Map. When reviewing the restaurant, customers can also review and give feedback to
									individual servers on the same page. The feedback method is consistent with that in
									the ServicePlus system. Below shows the interation flow of this alternative
									solution.
