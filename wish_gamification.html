    <h6>Background</h6>

    <p class="par">
      Wish is an ecommerce platform that serves an overlooked segment of
      value-conscious shoppers. This means that for Wish's users, a little bit
      of monetary motivation goes a long way. This made Incentives an important
      sector of the business. It’s also a very exciting field to design for: I
      was able to experiment with some wild ideas to elevate the shopping
      experience on Wish, especially through <b>gamification</b>.

    <h6>Incentives Framework</h6>
    <p class="par">
      To better understand and build up incentive programs on Wish, I worked
      with my PM to establish an incentives framework. We identified
      <b>5 key goals</b> along with the existing features that serve each goal.
      It helped us understand which area within the framework needs more
      attention (e.g. Retention 1, or long term retention only has one program);
      We also were able to see how some program has a bigger impact as it
      touches on many different key goals, e.g. the <i>Blitz Buy game</i> .

    <h6>Project 1: Blitz Buy Re-engagement</h6>
    <p class="par">
      Blitz Buy was the first and most impactful gamification feature in the app
      to date. Currently, when users spin the wheel, they will unlock a feed of
      10-100 items that have an extra discount. This feed is highly customized
      based on the user’s recent views. We learned that users has a
      <b>much higher conversion rate</b> on this feed compared to the main feed
    </p>
    <div align="center">

      <p class="caption">&#8593; Blitz Buy Before the Revamp</p>
    </div>
    <p class="par">
      Currently, <b>5%</b> of the user go to the blitz buy tab, yet it has
      proven a huge potential to generate sales. What if we can increase this
      number and drive more people to play the game?
    </p>

    <h5>Ideation</h5>

    <!-- <p class="par">
										Some initial concepts include:</p>

									<p class="par2">
										1. Adding an animated shine to the icon
									</p>
									<p class="par2">2. Red dot by the icon
									</p>
									<p class="par2">3. Changing the tab name to “Spin""Game""Deals"
									</p>
									<p class="par2">4. Adding tooltip

									</p>
									<p class="par2">5. Adding a splash screen when app launches

									</p>
									<p class="par2">6. Injecting a row as an entrance in feed

									</p>
									<p class="par2">7. Injecting floating icon in feed
									</p> -->

    <p class="par">
      After brainstorming different solutions, the team and I narrowed down to
      the following ideas:
    </p>

    </div>

    <h5>Results</h5>

    <p class="par">
      After rounds of experiments, we found out that
      <b>the combination of red dot and a floating button</b> on the feed has
      the biggest impact on our key metrics: It increased GMV by <b>2%</b> and
      traffic to the conversion on blitz buy tab by ~<b>120%</b>
      consistently.

    <h6>Ok, but...</h6>

    <p class="par">
      Although the two additions have proven to be successful, they are also
      very <b>aggressive</b> as a feature to keep showing to everyone in the
      app, and the effectiveness will be sure to wear off in the long term due
      to <b>fatigue</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      To understand how to make the features more effective and less intrusive,
      I carried out a <b>user testing</b> to understand the impact of this
      design on a qualitative level.
    </p>

    <h5>Persona</h5>

    <p class="par">
      A pattern emerged from the user study: there are
      <b>two distinct groups</b> of users on Wish when it comes to
      incentive/gamification programs. Below is some key characteristics of the
      two groups respectively.
    </p>

    <div align="center" style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 50px">
      <div>
        <img
          src="assets/images/wish_gamification/Persona1.png"
          style="border-radius: 10px; width: 600px; margin-bottom: 40px"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <img
          src="assets/images/wish_gamification/Persona2.png"
          style="border-radius: 10px; width: 600px"
        />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Research Findings</h5>

    <p class="par">
      We found out that the <b>floating button</b> is effective to drive
      exploration for new & casual users, yet more intrusive to power users.
      This is because the floating button can inspire curiosity of new/causal
      users who are not yet aware of the game, while power users have already
      built out the habit of going to the Blitz Buy tab regularly.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      As for the <b>red dot</b> on the Blitz Buy tab, the effect is also
      two-fold: Power users welcome the feature as it reminds them to go check
      out the tab on a daily basis, yet new and casual users easily neglect the
      tabs.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      Participants also voiced that they wouldn't pay much attention to either
      feature if they are in the app all the time, validating the assumption
      that persistent exposure of these reinforcement features will reduce the
      effectiveness in the long run.
    </p>

											style="  border-radius: 10px;  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.2);">



									</div> -->

    <h5>A new strategy!</h5>
    <p class="par">
      Based on the persona and user testing findings, we designed a customized
      strategy to engage different user groups effectively in the long run:
    </p>

    <p class="par2">1. For new users, show floating button and the red dot.</p>

    <p class="par2">
      2. For power users who interact with Blitz Buy on a regular basis, only
      show red dot for people who interact with BB on a regular basis
    </p>
    <p class="par2">
      3. For existing users who haven't use it for a while, take out the red dot
      and show floating button
    </p>

    <div style="height: 50px"></div>

    <h6>Project 2: Visual & Incentives Revamp</h6>

    <p class="par">
      In the first project, we managed to increase the traffic to the Blitz Buy
      game. However, the game itself has become stale over the years and lack
      the level of excitement to hook up more active players.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      To give a boost to engagement, we need to <b>refresh the visual</b>
      and
      <b>introduce diversified incentives</b> of the blitz buy game
    </p>

    <h5>Gamification model</h5>

    <p class="par">
      Before diving into the redesign, I spent some time studying the various
      gamification principles, models and case studies to identify new
      opportunities for the Blitz Buy.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      One of the most comprehensive and most referenced model in gamification is
      the
      <a
        href="https://yukaichou.com/"
        style="color: #66cc99; float: none; vertical-align: top; margin: 0px"
        >Octalysis framework
      </a>
      developed by Yu-kai Chou.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      Through an analysis on Blitz Buy using the framework (below), it's
      becoming clear that Blitz Buy is scoring low in several dimensions. Of
      course, as a promotional-focused game in a shopping app, its limited by
      its scope to strive for a high score in in all aspects (e.g. Meaning,
      Social Pressure). However, we can still see opportunities to improve in a
      few others, and to give a further boost to the existing strengths.

    <h5>Color & Visual Explorations</h5>

    <p class="par">
      Internally, we have long been seeking an opportunity to refresh the color
      palette and make the wheel more skeuomorphic to engage users from the
      first sight. Through the preliminary user testing, we also found out that
      a majority of new users to this page don’t understand what the keys and
      numbers represent on the original wheel. Therefore, my goal is to find out
      a new visual solution that is more appealing and effective in
      communicating the game mechanism.
    </p>

    <p class="par">
      I went through 4 major iterations, each round adopting feedback from users
      as well as team critiques.
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      *Fun fact*: Whenever I'm working on this project, the entire team would be
      attracted by all the colors on my screen, gather around me and offer a
      wide variety of opinions. As you can guess, this process made me finally
      become 100% comfortable with showing and receiving critiques on my WIP.

    <h5>Gamification exploration</h5>

      <p class="caption">&#8593; Game mechanism iteration</p>
    </div>

    <p class="par">
      After a few rounds of explorations inspired by a variety of real world
      games, we evaluated feasibility and landed on V4: Using icons to represent
      prizes, and showing more variations.
    </p>

    <p class="par">
      To diversify the prize, we started by adding 4 new prizes: free gift,
      category deals, express shipping discount and wishlist discount. We also
      wanted to introduce an empty slice on the wheel: If a player lands on the
      slice, they won’t get anything and will be told to try again tomorrow. The
      goal is to improve the <i>Unpredictability</i> and <i>Avoidance</i> aspect
      of the game, and to not discourage players, we planned to make the
      probability very low.
    </p>

    <div align="center">
      <img
        src="assets/images/wish_gamification/V1.png"
        style="margin-top: 20px; width: 1200px"
      />
      <p class="caption">&#8593; New Blitz Buy V1</p>
    </div>

    <p class="par">
      We ran a round of user testing based on this version below, and found out
      a few issues: All participants reported problem understanding the icons on
      the wheel just by looking at the icons After reading the explanations,
      some people still were confused about the difference between category
      deals and regular deals. Participants think ‘Try again’ is too
      discouraging...
    </p>

    <p class="par">
      Based on the feedback, we explored a new angle to intrigue players with
      the potential of a big prize, while not confusing/overwhelming them with
      too many abstract prizes. This led us to the version below:
    </p>

    <div align="center">

        &#8593; New Blitz Buy V2, based on user testing results
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="par">
      <b>How it works</b>: When entering Blitz Buy, the player will see a half
      wheel that shows three slices: a gift box, a bill, and a truck icon. The
      subtitle explained that they can win free gifts, gift card, and free
      shipping, corresponding with the three icons. The pin has a pulsing light,
      prompting people to tap and start the game. The wheel will then scale down
      and ascend to the center of the screen as it begins to spin.
    </p>

    <p class="par">
      When testing this new version with users, we got more positive reactions.
      All participants thought the new theme is <b>“fun and exciting”</b>.
      Almost all participants <b>understand the value</b> they could get from
      the game at first sight of the landing page. Furthermore, all participants
      thought it was very likely this new game will
      <b>change how they use Wish</b>.

  <h5>Reflection</h5>

  <p class="par">
    Once the new Blitz Buy game is ready to launch, we are going to monitor how
    the new design performs across our key metrics: <b>Conversion 1</b> (Add to
    Cart),
    <b>Conversion 2</b>
    (Checkout), <b>Retention 1</b> (Short term retention, or engagement level).
    With all the new features introduced to the game, we are also hopeful that
    Blitz Buy can address the other two metrics in the framework:
    <b>Retention 2</b> (7+ days long term retention), and <b>Growth</b>
    (feed scroll, time in app etc.)

    <p class="caption">&#8593; Incentives Framework</p>
  </div>

  <p class="par">
    As a next step, we are going to explore ways to further optimize the game
    following the Octalysis. Currently with the new design, we are able to see
    improvement on <i>Unpredictability, Scarcity,</i> and <i>Accomplishment</i>.
    If we can link prizes with the user’s engagement level by introducing
    streaks and leveling, we can make the game even more effective with the help
    of <i>Ownership</i> and <i> Avoidance</i>.
