		<h6>Background</h6>


		<p class="par">
			Wish is an ecommerce startup that strives to offer affordable and accessible
			goods to shoppers around the world. The majority of the items on Wish are
			unbranded and made in emerging countries. However, as Wish keeps growing, we are
			trying to branch out our offerings to include discounted local brands,
			especially in the US market. </p>
		<p class="par">
			In order to bring on brand partners on Wish and drive sales in this new
			category, the product is in great need for a refreshed brands shopping
			experience.</p>

		<h6>Understanding the problem</h6>


		<h7>Business Requirements</h7>
		<p class="par">
			One of our important stakeholder of the project was the BD team who work with
			brand partners. To help make it easier for brand partners to come onboard, the
			BD team had two requirements for the redesign: </p>

		<p class="par2">
			1. The new brands experience should be elegant & versatile that
			complements any
			consumer brand;</p>



		<p class="par2" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">2. It should be part of
			the Wish app, but at the same time
			unique
			and
			different from the regular Wish experience.
		</p>

		<h7>User Pain Points</h7>
		<p class="par">
			Although we already have a brands tab on Wish since the very beginning, it has a
			limited inventory and low traffic. To fully understand user’s
			pain
			points with the current brands tab, I carried out a preliminary user testing
			with 7 wish shoppers. </p>
		<div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 100px">
			<img src="assets/images/wishbrands/usertesting1.png" style="margin-top: 20px; width: 1000px ">
			<p class="caption">&#8593; Existing Wish homepage and the brands tab </p>
		</div>
		<p class="par">From the user testings, we identified some outstanding usability
			issues of the
			brands tab:
		</p>
		<p class="par2">
			1. Shoppers don’t understand the tab icon;</p>
		<p class="par2">2. On the brands tab, shoppers have trouble understanding how the
			experience is different from the popular feed on Wish;
		</p>
		<p class="par2">3. Shoppers have trouble exploring brands of interest through the
			current navigation system.
		</p>


		<h6>Design Goals, Metrics and Division</h6>


		<p class="par">Based on the business and user goals, We
			identified our design goals for this project. Because this is a big project, we
			divided the it into two parts: I would focus on the Brands Tab experience, and
			the other designer focuses on the brand search + product details experience.

		<h6>Foundational Research</h6>
		<div align="center">
			<img src="assets/images/wishbrands/inspo.png" style="margin-top: 20px;  width: 1000px  ">
		</div>

		<p class="caption">&#8593; Brand experience on Jet, Aliexpress and Walmart
		</p>

		<p class="par">I researched competitor apps that use brand navigation as a critical
			part of the shopping flow. There are three major practices: Surfacing brands
			on home
			page, surfacing hot brands under search results, or under specific categories.
			These findings acted as a baseline for my V1 explorations for the brands tab on
			Wish.
		</p>

		<h6>Design exploration V1</h6>


		<div align="center">

			<p class="caption">&#8593; Suggest top brands under categories</p>
		</div>



		<h6>Converging & Iteration</h6>
		<p class="par">The first direction was well received by the stakeholders as it
			maximizes the presence of brands both on
			the tab and within each category. However, at the time we would have limited
			brand partners and inventory especially for certain categories, making the
			navigation experience less ideal. Based on the feedback, I came up with new
			version that surfaces the global top brands on the homepage independent of the
			categories, and provides a way for shoppers to shop by categories and filter by
			brands on each category page.</p>
		<p class="par">On each brand page, we also introduced an authentic
			badge and message on a banner to reassure shoppers that they are browsing
			products from a trusted merchant.</p>
		</p>

		<div align="center">
			<img src="assets/images/wishbrands/round2.png" style="margin-top: 20px; width: 1000px;   ">

		</div>



		<h6>Sub project 1: <br />Brands Tab Icon Revamp</h6>


		<p class="par">In the preliminary user testing, one of the surprising finding was
			that very few Wish shoppers understand what the brands tab icon means even as
			long time shoppers on the platform
			.</p>

		<div style="margin-bottom: 100px">
			<p class="par1" style="font-weight: 600; border-left: 3px solid rgba(102,204,153,.94);">Q:
				What do you think this icon means? What do you expect to see after tapping
				on it?</p>
			<p class="par1">P1: “Not sure, maybe where I can find some special deals”
				<br /><br />P2: “There’s a star on the bag, so maybe saved items”
			</p>

		</div>


		<p class="par">I did an iconographic study on the brand tab icon, to incorporate the
			authentic badge into the old shopping bag icon, hopefully to bridge the gap we
			identified.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<img src="assets/images/wishbrands/icons.png"
				style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; width: 500px  ">
		</div>

		<p class="par" style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px">
			However, before we experimented the new tab icon, we tried a quick experiment to
			replace the icon with the word “Brands”, which increased brand tab GMV
			dramatically. We think the reason is by using a straightforward name, more
			shoppers with the need to shop branded goods visited the tab. We thus decided to
			go with text on the tab instead of a redesigned icon.</p>

		<div align="center">
			<img src="assets/images/wishbrands/headericon.png"
				style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 1000px   ">
			<p class="caption">&#8593; A picture is worth a thousand words? Not always true.
			</p>
		</div>



		<h6>Sub Project 2: <br />Redefining categories</h6>
		<p class="par">
			Unlike other shopping platforms, Wish users shop primarily through browsing the
			personalized feed. Others turn to search when they already know what they want.
			Only a small fraction of Wish shoppers use categories. However, brand products
			don't show up in the personalized feed, and we don't have an effective way for
			people to search for brand goods at the moment.</p>
		<p class="par">So how would navigating by categories help Wish shoppers on the
			brands tab?
		</p>

		<h7>Assumptions</h7>

		<p class="par">
			Through user testing and discussion with the PM, I came up with the following
			assumptions:</p>
		<p class="par">
			1. Users navigate by categories when they want to get an understanding of the
			offerings when they are new to the app, and</p>
		<p class="par">2. When they don't know exactly what they want but have certain
			categories of interest.
		</p>




		<h7>Suggestions</h7>

		<p class="par">Based on the user intentions and pain points, the new brands
			categories should:
		</p>

		<p class="par">1. Surface categories of high quality brand stock;</p>
		<p class="par">2. Surface categories with reasonable variety;</p>
		<p class="par">3. Show results under categories that correspond with the category
			name.</p>


		<div align="center">

			<p class="caption">&#8593; Suggestions on Brand Categories</p>
		</div>
		<p class="par">
			Through a brand search data deep dive, I was able to get a better understanding
			on Wish shopper's needs for new categories, and the relative importance of each
			category.
			Armed with the data and the guiding principles mentioned above, I made the
			following suggestions for a revised brand
			category list to the PM, the majority of which was adopted for the final
			implementation.</p>

			<img src="assets/images/wishbrands/newcategory.png"

			<p class="caption">&#8593; New Brand Categories </p>
		</div>






		<h6> Summative User Testing</h6>



		<p class="par">We again showed the prototype to 7 Wish shoppers to get their
			reaction and feedback on the new design. The feedback are fairly positive: </p>

		<p class="par1" style="margin-top: 40px">All participants noticed the authentic
			badge on the brand tab and
			appreciated the meaning; </p>
		<p class="par1">All preferred the new experience versus the current one. These
			keywords were used to
			describe the new experience: <strong style="font-weight: 500">clarification,
				highlight brands, clean,
				straightforward, easy to understand</strong>.
		<p class="par1">Most participants didn’t shop brand items on Wish before, but
			when exploring the new design many went straight to shop by brands, and
			almost all mentioned they like being able to browse by brand.</p>
		<p class="par" style="margin-top: 40px">We also learnt that many shoppers want
			to be able to further
			drill down to subcategories, and be able to see product names on the tile to
			help them identify brand items they want. We were not able to add those
			features in the first release due to technical constraint, but they are
			added to the future road map.</p>

		</div>

		<h6> Impact</h6>

		<p class="par">The new design experiment was run on Android for 50% of users for
			two weeks.</p>

		<p class="par1">"The New brand tab increases brand tab view to product click/add
			to cart by about 10%, and gmv per buyer significantly. "<br />
			<br />

			PM Update, July 2019
		</p>

		<p class="par">The data was consistent for the duration of the experiment, but
			due to small sample size the percentage increase was not not stat
			significant. However, with the trending positive result and the potential
			benefit to attract more partners, the team decided to ramp up the new design
			and port over to iOS and Web.</p>

		<h6>Looking Forward</h6>

		<p class="par">Now that we have an established brands experience, the team and I
			have started to look into further increasing the business impact of brands on
			Wish. Below are two of the initiatives.</p>

		<h7>Brands Stories</h7>
		<p class="par">We experimented with Brands Stories on the homepage of the Wish app
			to increase visibility and awareness of brands on Wish. We followed a similar
			stories format as on other social media apps (which are also recently
			adopted by a variety of apps like Yelp and Googla Map) to reduce friction of
			entry.</p>

			<p class="caption">&#8593; Brands Stories with an entry point on the homepage
			</p>

		</div>

		<div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">

			<div align="center" class="row" style="width: 800px;">
				<div class="col-md-6"><img src="assets/images/wishbrands/story1.gif" style=" border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.2); 
											margin-top: 50px; width: 300px;">
				</div>

											margin-top: 50px; width: 300px;">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption" style="margin-top: 40px;">&#8593; Two examples for brands
				stories
			</p>
		</div>

		<p class="par">As an MVP, we partnered with some of the popular brands to customize
			the stories for them. To make Brands Stories scalable, I created templates that
			could be reusable for all brands assets including static images and videos. </p>

		<div align="center">

			<p class="caption">&#8593; Templates for brands stories
			</p>

		</div>


		<h7>Brands Store Front</h7>
		<p class="par">As most of our branded goods come from authorized third party sellers
			and there are usually many sellers for a given brand, the team wants to provide
			stores a customizable experience to distinguish from each other. This would also
			help users build trust with a specific store.</p>
